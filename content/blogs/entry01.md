it's been a while since i got this site up and running but hadn't had any idea about what to
do in here. there was a blur idea of something like <!-- more -->keeping a journal or writing poems/stories but 
well i aint no poet and them words dont rhyme themselves. so, i'll be keeping a journal which rather focuses on what i learnt that day.

starting tomorrow i'll be uplading a blog daily about my journey of learning c++ . basically i'll be teaching what i learnt that day.or perhaps just rant about what i didnt understand.


off i go, see you tomorrow.
